My fork of [One Dark Pro](https://github.com/Binaryify/OneDark-Pro). Customized for me. The extension can be found [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=andrenguyener.Memoir-One) or installed with `ext install Memoir-One`.

If you would like to play around with new colors, use the setting workbench.colorCustomizations to customize the currently selected theme.

For example, you can add this snippet in your "settings.json" file:

```json
"workbench.colorCustomizations":{
  "tab.activeBackground": "#282c34",
  "activityBar.background": "#282c34",
  "editorGroup.background": "#282c34",
  "sideBar.background": "#282c34"
}
```
